# weatherplanner
The main objective of this project is to use the Dark Sky API [ https://darksky.net ]
in order to display an accurate Current and 5 day Forecast. 

A future goal is to be able to 
subscribe to specific dates in the future and be notified of variance from your selected 
weather preferences.
